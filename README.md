# TRPG
An RPG game based on the story of Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Still in development. Usually I would keep it private until it totally finished, but it is the largest project I've ever created so I want to pin it on my main page as a showcase.  

This game will use UIKit, SpriteKit and SwiftUI frameworks, and the game will follow the rule of D&D 5e. It might be interesting to combine the eastern and western factors together.  

Here are some early preview screenshot of this game:
